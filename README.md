### üîå Project Overview

**Crop Disease Detection and Advisory Chatbot** is an advanced application designed to assist farmers in identifying crop diseases from images and providing relevant advisory based on the diagnosis. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing techniques, this chatbot leverages `OpenCV` and `TensorFlow` for image analysis and `spaCy` for generating text-based advice. It also integrates with agricultural databases to provide comprehensive support.

### üîå Key Features

- **Disease Identification:** Analyzes images of crops using `OpenCV` and `TensorFlow` to detect and identify various crop diseases accurately.

- **Advisory Chatbot:** Provides text-based advice and recommendations through a chatbot interface, utilizing `spaCy` for natural language processing to generate useful insights.

- **Agricultural Database Integration:** Accesses agricultural databases for additional support and information related to crop diseases and treatment options.

- **User-Friendly Interaction:** Designed for ease of use, allowing farmers to upload images and receive instant feedback and guidance through the chatbot interface.

- **Comprehensive Support:** Combines image analysis and text-based recommendations to offer a complete solution for disease identification and management.
